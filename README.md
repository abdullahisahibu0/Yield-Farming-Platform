## Features

- Create and manage multiple farming pools
- Stake tokens and earn rewards
- Implement various yield-bearing tokens
- Fetch external price data for reward calculations
- Time-based restrictions on withdrawals

## Smart Contracts

The platform consists of the following smart contracts:

1. **Farm Contract (`farm.clar`)**: Manages staking and reward distribution for multiple farming pools.
2. **Token Contract (`token.clar`)**: Implements SIP-010 compliant fungible tokens for yield-bearing assets.
3. **Oracle Contract (`oracle.clar`)**: Fetches and stores external price data for reward calculations.
4. **Timelock Contract (`timelock.clar`)**: Implements time-based restrictions on token withdrawals.
